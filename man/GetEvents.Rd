\title{Get information about FRC events}
\usage{
GetEvents(session, event = NULL, team = NULL, district = NULL,
  exclude_district = NULL, mod_since = NULL, only_mod_since = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{session}{A Session object created with \code{GetSession()}.}

\item{event}{A character vector containing a FIRST API event code. If event
is specified, \code{GetEvents()} will return results only for the specified
event. Optional.}

\item{team}{An integer vector containing a team number. Optional}

\item{district}{A character vector containing the FIRST API district code
(see \code{GetDistricts()}). If \code{district} is specified,
\code{GetTeams()} will filter results to only the events in the specified
district.}

\item{exclude_district}{A logical vector. If set to \code{TRUE}, district
events are excluded from results. Optional.}

\item{mod_since}{A character vector containing an HTTP formatted date and
time. Returns \code{NA} if no changes have been made to the requested data
since the date and time provided. Optional.}

\item{only_mod_since}{A character vector containing an HTTP formatted date
and time. This function only returns data that has changed since the date
and time provided. Optional.}
}
\value{
Depending on the \code{session$format} value, returns JSON text, an
  XML::XMLDocument object, or a data.frame with class set to c("data.frame,
  "Events"). Returns a logical vector of length one with value \code{NA} if
  data is unchanged since date and time passed in arguments \code{mod_since}
  or \code{only_mod_since}.

\details{
\code{GetEvents} will accept either the \code{team} or \code{district}
parameters, neither parameter, or both parameters. If neither \code{team} nor
\code{district} are specified, \code{GetEvents} returns all FRC events for
the competition season. If \code{team} is specified, the results are filtered
to only the events in which the FRC team participated. Similarly, if
\code{district} is specified, the results are filtered to only the events
that occurred within the specified district. If \code{exclude_district} is
set to TRUE, then only non-district events are returned. The \code{district}
and \code{exclude_district} events may not be specified at the same time.

Throws an error if \code{team} is specified and any other arguments are
specified, or if both the \code{district} and \code{exclude_district}
arguments are specified.

The FIRST API URL format is:

\code{https://frc-api.firstinspires.org/v2.0/season/events?
  teamNumber=team&districtCode=district&excludeDistrict=district}
